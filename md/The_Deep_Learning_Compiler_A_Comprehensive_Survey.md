# The_Deep_Learning_Compiler_A_Comprehensive_Survey
## Question
- TODO
## Function
- Similarly, the DL compilers take the DL models
described in different DL frameworks as input, and then generate optimized codes for diverse DL hardware as
output
## Key Concepts
- Tensorflow XLA and TVM
- DL oriented multi-level IRs
- frontend/backend optimization
